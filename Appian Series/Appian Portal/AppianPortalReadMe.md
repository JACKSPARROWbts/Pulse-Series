- Appian Portals is currently only supported for Appian Cloud customers. Additionally, if your environment is behind a VPN, you cannot connect a portal to it to read or write data.
- Portal worked on isolated architecture that is independent from Appian.To upload files in Appian ```File upload or signature component --->Use a!submitUploadedfiles() function in submit button ---> specify target document folder ---> service account with Viewer permissions to target folder```. To download document ```Document download link or document image ---> Files to download ---> Document folder for our files ---> service account with viewer permissions to documents and folder ```.
- To use partially compatible capabilities and functions, connect to them using a web API and integration.The ```a!submitUploadedFiles() and a!verifyRecaptcha()``` functions only work in a published portal. You can't test them in the interface object itself.
- In your Appian environment, make sure you are in the ```Portals Publishers group``` to update, delete,publish portals.If Portal Publishing Manager site is not visible to us make sure we are in Portals Publishers Group.
- To setup with ReCaptcha with Portal - ```Create project in Google Admin console``` ---> ```Note Project ID``` ---> ```Create API and SITE keys using Google documentation```(API Key allow portal to communicate with reCaptcha server,site key allow to use reCaptcha on our portal since Appian only supports v3 reCaptcha so our site key ```must be score-based site key```) ---> In portal page,click "Use google reCaptcha to protect your page" ---> paste site and API key in that box in manager ---> Enter reCaptcha project ID when we created project in google.
