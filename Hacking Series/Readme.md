# Bluetooth hacking

- ```Bluez``` has multiple tools for bluetooth hacking.[Github link](https://github.com/bluez).We can use ```Panda Bluetooth 4.0 USB Nano Adapter```,[Buy here](https://amzn.to/3NlSlbQ).Use ```hcitool``` to scan bluetooth devices.[See more](https://youtu.be/3yiT_WMlosg).```MultiBlue Dongle USB Blueooth V3.0 HiD``` flashed with different class to act as keyboard.```sudo apt install spooftooph``` allows us to mac address of bluetooth. ```Programming Logic Controllers``` have scehmatic diagrams,learn PLC Programming (modbus,DNP3 and ladder logic simulations),For ex: search ```inurl:/Portal/Portal.mwsl``` to find PLC,schematics of some stations.

# WPA,WPA2 Hacking

-WPA and WPA2 security executed without utilizing the WI-FI protected setup(WPS) highlight are unaffected by the security defenselessness.```airodump-ng``` will use for capturing handshakes and wifi cracking

# Others

- What is a C2 server? A command-and-control server,computer that is controlled by a cybercriminal,used by attackers to maintain communications and send commands to systems inside a target network compromised by malware.

- TrustWave Security Site to learn about the security attacks happening in the organization.Install kali linux in windows 11 and windows 10 using wsgl and wsl [video](https://youtu.be/27Wn921q_BQ)
- ```pwntools``` is a CTF framework and exploit development library in python. Use ```import pwn``` for using it. Use ```Hack the box,portswigger.net,Bandit war games,Tryhackme.com,DamnVulnerableNugget``` for learning hacking.
-```strace``` intercepts system calls make by the glibc and other libraries directly into the Linux Kernel,use ptrace to inspect the system calls of a process. ```ltrace``` intercepts library calls and system calls made by your application to C libraries such as the glibc.```Upx``` ultimate packer for executables works by renaming the header names (UPX0/UPX1),reduce file size, this helps mask the malware as a . jpg or to spread through emails
- Police groups like NSA can monitor us using program called ```XKeyScore```. 
- ```Pyramid of pain``` includes hash values because of hash collision,Ip Addresses because of VPN change ip addresses.

# NMAP 
- ```-sS``` to run stealth TCP scan to find specific TCP based port is open.```-Pn``` tells Nmap to not use ping to find whether a system is running,instead it considers all hosts alive.If using Internet based penetration tests ,use this flag because most networks don't allow ```Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)``` which is protocol that ping uses.
- ```-A``` flag gives more information about target system.To generate the XML file to import nmap into Metasploit use ```nmap -Pn -sS -A -oX Subnet1 192.168.1.0/24 > db_connect postgres:toor@127.0.0.1/msf3 > db_import Subnet1.xml > db_hosts -c address``` to run successfully. 
-Use ```nmap -PN -sI <idle_system> <RHOST>``` to discover a number of open ports on our target system without sending a single packet to the system.Use Nmap in Metasploit using ```db_nmap -sS -A <RHOST>```, ```db_serices``` to check the results from scan that stored in db.

# Metasploit

- Developed by HD Moore in Oct 2003 with 11 exploits,Metasploit 2.0 in 2004 along with Spoonm with 19 exploits,27 payloads,Metasploit 3.0 in 2007.Migration from perl to ruby took 18 months,150000 of new code lines.2009 Metasploit acquired by Rapid 7 and launched Metasploit Express,Metasploit pro.
-```Pre-engagement interactions, Intelligence gathering,Threat modeling,Vulnerability analysis,Exploitation, Post exploitation,Reporting``` are the phases of attacking.```Overt or whitehat and Covert or blackhat``` are the types of pentest.
- ```Armitage``` created by Raphael Mudge.```msfencode``` to avoid bad characters and evade antivirus and IDS by encoding original payload and the best one is ```x86/shikata_ga_nai```.
-```Passive Information Gathering```,```OSINT``` gather information about target without touching their systems.```TCP Idle scan``` allows to scan target stealthily by spoofing IP of another host on the network,For this to work locate idle host on network that use incremental IP IDs and while scanning if it break in predictability of IP ID sequence then it means that it discovered an open port,use ```auxiliary/scanner/ip/ipidseq``` to check this.
- To connect MSF with db: ```MSF supports postgresql,Mysql > /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 start > DB has started so give username(default:postgres),password(default:toor) > db_connect postgres:toor@127.0.0.1/<db_name> > db_status```.
- ```Pivoting``` allows to use internally connected systems to route traffic to network that would otherwise be inaccessible,allows to access NAT based firewall devices and use compromised internal system to pass traffic to internally hosted private IP-based systems to penetrate network farther behind the firewall.use ```scanner/potscan/syn``` to find tcp port open.
- Use ```scanner/mssql/mssql_ping``` to find which port the MS SQL is running.Use ```scanner/ssh/ssh_version``` to find the ssh version in the target.Use ```scanner/ftp/ftp_version``` to find the ftp version.Use ```auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous``` to find whether ftp server allows anonymous login or not.Use ```scanner/snmp/snmp_enum``` that is designed specifically for SNMP sweeps.Keep in mind that the read-only (RO) and read/write (RW) community strings will play an important role in the type of information you will be able to extract from a given device. On Windows-based devices configured with SNMP, you can often use the RO or RW community strings to extract patch levels, running services, usernames, uptime, routes, and other information that can make things easier.
(Community strings are essentially passwords used to query a device for information or to write configuration information to the device.)
- To import the fully scanned report from NeExpose to MSF ```create new db by db_connect postgres:toor@127.0.0.1/msf5 > load nexpose > help > db_import /tmp/report.xml > db_hosts -c address,svcs,vulns > db_vulns > nexpose_connect -h > nexpose_scan RHOST > db_hosts > db_vulns```.
- To import Nessus report to MSF ```db_destroy postgres:toor@127.0.0.1/msf5 > db_connect postgres:toor@127.0.0.1/msf5 > nessus_connect user:password@<local_ip>:<nessus_port> > nessus_policy_list > nessus_scan_new > nessus_scan_status > nessus_report_list > nessus_report_get <ID from that before command> or db_import report.nessus > db_hosts -c address,svcs,vulns > db_vulns```. We can use Nessus Bridge plugin to use Nessus in MSF.
- Use ```auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login``` to login smb, but it's loud i.e. each login attempt will show up in the event logs of every Windows box it encounters.Older versions of VNC(4.1.1) allow blank passwords so check whether VNC has password or not using use ```auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth```.Connect VNC with ```vncviewer <ip_address>```.
- ```msfbinscan,msfconsole,msfd,msfdb,msfelfscan,msfmachscan,msfpescan,msfrop, msfrpc,msfrpcd,msfupdate,msfvenom``` are preinstalled in MSF.
- The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is typically used in network devices to report information such as bandwidth utilization, collision rates, and other information
